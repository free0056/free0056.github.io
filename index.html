				<h1>Robert Freeman</h1>
				<h2>Graphic Designer</h2>

		
			
				<p>I always liked to draw since a young age. I don't have much background in art other than making a hobby of it before deciding to take it on as a career choice. The first step in my plan was to check out what programs were available in my area and the one that stood out to me was at Algonquin College. I left my application rather last minute and the entry required me to make a portfolio of my work. Well I didn't have much in the way of real portfolio pieces so I went hard to work for the month of august and submitted my portfolio jus before the final deadline. Happily I made the cut and I have enjoyed expanding my craft ever since. 
				</p>
				
				<p>I am currently in my final year and I have produced, what I think is some solid work, and in the learning process probably a few not so solid. That's what makes design so exciting to me, however. There is always new inspiration and new ways to improve. I hope to make an impact on the industry and make a name for myself as a quality graphic designer and it's my intetntion to push myself and try to use my knowledge to create designs that will please my clients everywhere from full responsive web design to 1x1 inch logos, the thought process is the same: to make designs that matter.
